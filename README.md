FastAPI Middle Office Ware

This is a FastAPI library based on the Safaricom MPESA daraja API. 

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

For the M-Pesa client, this library uses the python asynchronous client called aiohttp. 
aiohttp is a versatile asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for Python that supports both client and server-side applications.
